Hotel Reviews Analysis using NLP techniques

I conducted an analysis of hotel reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights from customer feedback. The reviews were processed to extract sentiments and key topics using methods such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. After performing the analysis, I visualized the results using the Folium library in Python, creating an interactive map that displayed the geographical distribution of reviews across different hotel locations. This allowed for easy exploration of review data, where users could click on specific locations to see aggregated reviews and sentiment scores. This approach provided a clear and intuitive way to analyze hotel reviews and helped identify trends and areas for improvement in customer service.
